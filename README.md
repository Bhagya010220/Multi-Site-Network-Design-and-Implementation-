# Multi-Site-Network-Design-and-Implementation-
As part of an academic group project, I played a pivotal role in designing and implementing a multi-site network for E-Gaming Unlimited. This complex task involved crafting a resilient network architecture with considerations for redundancy and high-performance hardware selection. I also researched and implemented Layer 2 and Layer 3 technologies to optimize data flow within the network and strategically chose WAN technologies for connecting geographically dispersed locations. The practical application of these skills culminated in configuring the network using Packet Tracer, ensuring its seamless functionality.
